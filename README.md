# NEOVIM CONFIG
This Neovim Config is based on Chris@Machine's neovim from scratch.

The final purpose is configure the whole neovim IDE with lua. Right now seems bloated but will be debloated in the future.

Lead key is <space> and will pop up a menu with different hotkeys with access and explainatory usage. If the menu has different color and a '+' in front of the hotkey-name then it means there are more options inside, so you'll need to chain commands. For example, to pop up "Alpha" menu again just <space>a, and Alpha menu will pop up. In case you want to open LSP's hotkeys then <space>l and another menu will pop up with every single LSP command added on lua/user/whichkey.lua

## Used pluggins.

## Used hotkeys.
